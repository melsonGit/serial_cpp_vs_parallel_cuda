# serial_cpp_vs_parallel_cuda
Dissertation work for completion of MSc ICT. This implementation alongside my written thesis achieved a 77% mark.
File raw_data.xlsx details runtime data of both parallel and serial programs.

# Why did I start this project?

I started this project to not only fulfill my MSc, but I also hold a keen interest in the roles of the GPU/GPGPU (graphics processing unit/ general-purpose graphics processing unit) and CPU (central processing unit). I wanted to test the capabilities of both components in numerous environments that were computationally intensive enough to determine where the strengths of GPU/GPGPUs and CPUs lie. Combining that with my passion for coding; I went down the rabbit hole that is CUDA (compute unified device architecture). 

# Hurdles to overcome

My first hurdle was overcoming the technical issues that came with setting up CUDA inside the VS (visual studio) environment. After **3** failed attempts and pain-stakingly configuring my workstation, I was able to get CUDA up and running. With documentation and a few online video tutorials to guide me, I was able to develop **8** mini-programs which tested the GPU/GPGPU and CPU using arithmetic operations (detailed below). Being more acclimated to an OOP approach; I found myself steering more towards procedural programming as I became more familiar with CUDA.
